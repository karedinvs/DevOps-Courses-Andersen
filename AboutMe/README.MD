# About myself


A couple of lines about me below, but I have a linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadim-karedin-8607a0a9/), not much written there. There's a picture of me there, maybe we'll see each other somewhere and say hello.

I would be happy to meet you.
______________

So my name is Vadim Karedin, as you understood from my Linkedin profile. At the moment I work in a holding called VGI as a head of IT department, maybe CIO.

I know that firstly I sacrifice my salary (hopefully not for long), secondly I sacrifice my free time to spend with my family.  Now there are no big projects at work.
In January I started to study DevOps in [TeachMeSkill](https://teachmeskills.by/kursy-programmirovaniya/kursy-dev-ops-online).  In 2 months the study will be finished.

### Andersen's DevOps course is interesting because:
1) Hoping to get even more knowledge. But maybe you will hire me sooner :-)
2) My contract ends at the end of September and I won't be extending it.
3) I want to change my profession, because I want to look at IT from the other side.

### I expect from the course:

1) Cool knowledge from the cool teachers.
2) High-quality material
3) Feedback.

At the start of my career, I have worked with networks, virtualization, implemented a lot of projects. This knowledge helps me a lot now.


I have a beloved wife, son, fish. I live in Minsk (but I would like to relocate).
I need to learn conversational English. I want to learn it with a teacher individually.

In general, this is all I wanted to say and this is a "couple of lines"
