(NAT Gateway didn't work, although I did everything according to the manual, I still need help)
- The count parameter in AWS is the same as in Terraform
- DevOps Vadim has a good microphone. Like a microphone on the radio :-)

- Looked at how AWS RDS works with master-master|master-slave replication
- The message from the SAN "firmw–∞re is invalid" does not always mean bad. This was written in the SAN upgrade manual
